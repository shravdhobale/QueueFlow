3. ENHANCE BUSINESS QUEUE MANAGEMENT
Fix Active Queue Functionality:

text
Current Queue Management Panel Should Display:
- List of all customers in queue (approved + pending)
- Each row shows:
  * Position number
  * Customer name & phone
  * Service requested  
  * Join time
  * Status (Pending Approval / Approved / In Service / Completed)
  * Action buttons (Approve/Reject, Start Service, Mark Complete)

Queue Management Actions:
1. "Approve Customer" button
   - Changes status from pending to approved
   - Assigns estimated service time
   - Sends approval notification to customer
   - Updates queue positions for all customers

2. "Start Service" button  
   - Changes status to "In Service"
   - Starts service timer
   - Sends "Your turn now" notification

3. "Mark Complete" button
   - Removes from active queue
   - Updates statistics
   - Sends completion notification
Business Service Time Management:

text
Add Service Configuration:
- Business can set standard service times per service type
- Example: "Haircut - 30 mins", "Oil Change - 45 mins"
- These times are used for wait time calculations
- Business can adjust individual appointment times

Service Time Interface:
- Dropdown to select standard time OR
- Manual input field for custom duration
- Time gets added when customer is approved
4. IMPLEMENT NOTIFICATION SYSTEM
Notification Triggers & Messages:

javascript
Notification Events:
1. Queue Join Confirmation
   "Thanks {name}! You're added to the queue at {business}. You'll be notified when approved."

2. Business Approval Notification  
   "Great news {name}! {business} has approved your queue request. Your estimated wait time is {time}. You'll get notified 15 minutes before your turn."

3. 15-Minute Warning
   "Hi {name}, you're about 15 minutes away from your appointment at {business}. Please start heading over!"

4. Your Turn Alert
   "Hi {name}, it's your turn at {business}! Please arrive now for your {service}."

5. Service Started
   "Your {service} has started at {business}. Estimated completion: {time}."
Implementation Requirements:

Use email notifications (easier to implement than SMS initially)

Add notification preferences in customer profile
